    Prawn biryani is a good source of vitamin B5, phosphorus, manganese, vitamin E, and an excellent source of protein, vitamin B6, copper, selenium, beta carotene, and lutein. <br>It helps strengthen muscles and boost immunity.
    This prawn biryani recipe is the way I make for the foodies at home. It is much simpler to make than any other biryani varieties.<br> A simple salan or gravy, a raita or a bowl of fresh veggie salad goes well with this biryani.
    Prawns are a low-fat protein source. However, they are high in unsaturated fats or good fats. A good source of trace minerals â€“ Prawns are an excellent source of trace minerals such as zinc, iodine, and selenium. <br>
    Iodine is required to sustain thyroid gland function, while zinc and selenium help the immune system.<br>Hyderabadi Biryani is the most popular biryani in India because of its meticulous blend of spices, nestled with the tenderness of meat and veggies. Its colorful texture and flavorful aroma reach your senses to transform your meals into a satisfying experience.<br>
     No other biryani matches the number of spices used in it.
