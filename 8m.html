        Blend red chillies and cashew nuts into a fine paste. In a bowl, mix mutton, ginger-garlic paste and beaten curd. Marinate for 2 hours.<br>
In a wok, heat oil and add the chilli-cashew paste with 4 tablespoons of milk.<br> Stir-fry for about a few seconds and add marinated mutton, onion, garam masala and salt. 
When the milk begins to separate, add a cup and a half of warm water and pressure cook until the mutton becomes tender.<br>
In a deep bottomed pan, heat oil and saut√© cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and bay leaves.<br> Add the remaining milk, rice, green chillies, salt and enough water for the rice to cook. In another bowl, mix coriander, mint, fried onions and set aside.<br>
In a pot, add a layer of rice and top it with mutton.<br> Sprinkle half of the coriander-mint mixture and lemon juice. Add another layer of rice and drizzle saffron milk and ghee.<br> Cover tightly and cook for about 30 minutes on extremely low flame.
Serve hot with a bowl full of raita, some lemon wedges and onions slices.
